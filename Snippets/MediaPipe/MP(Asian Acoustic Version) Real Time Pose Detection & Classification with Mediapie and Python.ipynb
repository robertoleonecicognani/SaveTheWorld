    "Pose Detection (also known as Pose Estimation) is a widely used computer vision task that enables you to predict humans poses in images or videos by localizing the key body joints (also reffered  as landmarks), these are elbows, shoulders, and knees, etc. \n",

    "[MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/pose.html) provides a robust solution capable of predicting **thirty-three 3D landmarks** on a human body in real-time with high accuracy even on CPU. It utilizes a two-step machine learning pipeline, by using a detector it first localizes the person within the frame and then uses the pose landmarks detector to predict the  landmarks within the region of interest.\n",

    "For the videos, the detector is used only for the very first frame and then the ROI is derived from the previous frame’s pose landmarks using a tracking method. Also when the tracker loses track of the identify body pose presence in a frame, the detector is invoked again for the next frame which reduces the computation and latency. The image below shows the thirty-three pose landmarks along with their indexes.\n",
